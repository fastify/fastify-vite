# **`@fastify/vite`**

This [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) plugin lets you:

- run Vite's development server as middleware in your Fastify server
  - in development mode only, naturally
- **expose** your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application to your Fastify application
  - with configuration hooks to **ease router integration** and **other customizations**
- automatically serve your Vite production bundle, inferred from a Vite configuration file.

This repository is also the home of `@fastify/vue` and `@fastify/react`.

They provide basic Nuxt and Next.js-like functionality, respectively, through `@fastify/vite`.

Official examples (low-level integration) can be found in [`examples/`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/main/examples).

Official starters (DX-focused) using `@fastify/vue` and `@fastify/react` can be found in [`starters/`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/main/starters).

The package's author [has also written a book covering the stack](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/happy-little-monoliths).
