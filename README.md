# **`@fastify/vite`**

This [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) plugin lets you:

- run Vite's development server as middleware in your Fastify server
  - in development mode only, naturally
- **expose** your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application to your Fastify application
  - with configuration hooks to **ease router integration** and **other customizations**
- automatically serve your Vite production bundle, inferred from a Vite configuration file.

This repository is also the home of `@fastify/vue` and `@fastify/react`, which are _renderer packages_ *for* `@fastify/vite` and provide basic Nuxt and Next.js-like (respectively) functionality for the latest versions of Vue and React. 

See the [full documentation suite](https://fastify-vite.dev) to learn more.

Official examples can be found in [`examples/`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/examples).
