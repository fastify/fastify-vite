# Community Examples

This directory contains original examples from past `@fastify/vite` releases which are presently unmaintained. 

Namely, outdated React (still using React v18), Solid and Svelte examples:

- [`solid-vanilla`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/solid-vanilla)
- [`solid-hydration`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/solid-hydration)
- [`svelte-vanilla`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/svelte-vanilla)
- [`svelte-hydration`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/svelte-hydration)

Work on React v19 support for has already started, but we need maintainers for the Solid and Svelte examples â€” who are also interested in seeing `@fastify/solid` and `@fastify/svelte` come to life in the molds of `@fastify/vue` and `@fastify/react`.

Please join the `#frontend` channel on Fastify's Discord if you're looking to contribute!
