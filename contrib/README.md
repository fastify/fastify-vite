# Community Examples

This directory contains original examples from past `@fastify/vite` releases which are presently unmaintained. 

Namely, outdated React (still using React v18), Solid and Svelte examples:

- [react-vanilla](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/react-vanilla)
- [react-vanilla-spa](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/react-vanilla-spa)
- [react-hydration](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/react-hydration)
- [react-streaming](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/react-streaming)
- [react-next](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/react-next)
- [solid-vanilla](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/solid-vanilla)
- [solid-hydration](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/solid-hydration)
- [svelte-vanilla](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/svelte-vanilla)
- [svelte-hydration](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/tree/dev/contrib/svelte-hydration)

Work on React v19 support for has already started, but we need maintainers for the Solid and Svelte examples â€” and who are interested in seeing `@fastify/solid` and `@fastify/svelte` come to life in the molds of `@fastify/vue` and `@fastify/react`.
