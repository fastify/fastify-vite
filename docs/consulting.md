# Consulting

As a means of supporting my work on this project, [I've](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br) opened consulting slots on my calendar every Saturday. This is mainly targeted at folks using or considering using **`@fastify/vite`** but I can assist in many other areas as well.

## Expertise

I'm an expert in JavaScript and Node.js performance, and SSR technology in general. I'm a former core contributor to the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) framework and have been involved with the Fastify project for nearly three years since I started working on **`@fastify/vite`**. Previously I was a Python engineer for 10+ years.

I'm a **Principal Engineer** at [feature.fm](https://www.feature.fm/). Previously I was **Principal Engineer** at [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/) and an **Engineering Manager** at [NearForm](https://nearform.com/).
