> **If you're coming from [Next.js][next] or [Nuxt.js][nuxt] and are looking for a practical Fastify-flavored replacement, jump straight to the [@fastify/react](/react/) or [@fastify/vue](/vue/) documentation sections.** All topics in this documentation section **cover @fastify/vite from the ground up**, targeted mainly at framework authors, and of course, potential contributors to [@fastify/react](/react/), [@fastify/vue](/vue/) and perhaps new core renderers for other frameworks.
