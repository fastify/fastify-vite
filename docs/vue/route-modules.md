# Route Modules

Route modules are Vue components placed under the [route search path](/vue/router-setup#routes-location), set to `<project-root>/pages` by default, or `client/pages` in the starter template, which follows the recommendation of using `client/` as the Vite project root.

Below is a rundown of supported exports:

**Rendering modes** are covered in detail [here](/vue/rendering-modes).

## Data fetching

**`@fastify/vue`** implements the `getServerSideProps()` style of data fetching via the `getData()` route module export.

It will run server-side before any SSR takes place, so any data fetched is made available to the route component (on the [route context](/vue/route-context)) before it even starts to render. During first render, any data retrieved on the server is automatically sent to the client for hydration, as part of the the route context.

During client-side navigation (post first-render), a JSON request is fired to an internal endpoint **automatically registered** by `@fastify/vite` for running the `getData()` function for that route on the server, exactly the same way `getServerSideProps()` works in **Next.js**.

The objet returned by `getData()` gets automatically assigned as `data` in the [universal route context](/vue/route-context) object and is accessible from `getMeta()` and `onEnter()` functions and also via the `useRouteContext()` hook.

```vue
<template>
  <p>{data.message}</p>
</template>

<script>
import { useRouteContext } from '@fastify/vue/client'

export function getData (ctx) {
  return {
    message: 'Hello from getData!',
  }
}

export default {
  setup () {
    const { data } = useRouteContext()
    return { data }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Page metadata

**`@fastify/vue`** renders `<head>` elements **independently** from SSR. This allows you to fetch data for populating `<meta>` tags first, stream them right away to the client, and only then perform SSR.

To populate `<head>` elements, export a `getMeta()` function that returns an object matching the interface expected by [unhead](https://github.com/unjs/unhead):

```ts
interface ReactiveHead {
    /**
     * The `<title>` HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.
     * It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title
     */
    title?: ResolvableTitle;
    /**
     * Generate the title from a template.
     */
    titleTemplate?: ResolvableTitleTemplate;
    /**
     * Variables used to substitute in the title and meta content.
     */
    templateParams?: ResolvableProperties<{
        separator?: '|' | '-' | 'Â·' | string;
    } & Record<string, Stringable | ResolvableProperties<Record<string, Stringable>>>>;
    /**
     * The `<base>` HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document.
     * There can be only one <base> element in a document.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base
     */
    base?: ResolvableBase;
    /**
     * The `<link>` HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.
     * This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons
     * (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-as
     */
    link?: ResolvableArray<ResolvableLink>;
    /**
     * The `<meta>` element represents metadata that cannot be expressed in other HTML elements, like `<link>` or `<script>`.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta
     */
    meta?: ResolvableArray<ResolvableMeta>;
    /**
     * The `<style>` HTML element contains style information for a document, or part of a document.
     * It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing the `<style>` element.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style
     */
    style?: ResolvableArray<(ResolvableStyle | string)>;
    /**
     * The `<script>` HTML element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script
     */
    script?: ResolvableArray<(ResolvableScript | string)>;
    /**
     * The `<noscript>` HTML element defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported
     * or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript
     */
    noscript?: ResolvableArray<(ResolvableNoscript | string)>;
    /**
     * Attributes for the `<html>` HTML element.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html
     */
    htmlAttrs?: ResolvableHtmlAttributes;
    /**
     * Attributes for the `<body>` HTML element.
     *
     * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body
     */
    bodyAttrs?: ResolvableBodyAttributes;
}
```

It receives the [route context](/vue/route-context) as first parameter and runs right after `getData()`, giving you access to `data` when generate your tags.

It will populate the `head` object in the [route context](/vue/route-context).

```vue
<template>
  <p>Route with meta tags.</p>
</template>

<script>
export function getData () {
  return {
    page: {
      title: 'Page title',
    }
  }
}

export function getMeta (ctx) {
  return {
    title: ctx.data.page.title,
    meta: [
      { name: 'twitter:title', content: ctx.data.page.title },
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```

## The onEnter event

The `onEnter()` function export is executed **just before** the route renders, **both in SSR and during client-side navigation**. That is, the first time a route renders on the server, `onEnter()` runs on the server. Then, since it already ran on the server, **it doesn't run again on the client for that first route**. But if you navigate to another route on the client using `<router-link>`, it triggered again.

It receives the [route context](/vue/route-context) as first parameter, so you can use it to make changes to `data`, `head` and `state` if needed.

[route-context]: https://github.com/fastify/fastify-dx/blob/main/docs/vue/route-context.md

```html
<template>
  <p>No pre-rendered HTML sent to the browser.</p>
</template>

<script>
export function onEnter (ctx) {
  if (ctx.server?.underPressure) {
    ctx.clientOnly = true
  }
}
</script>
```

The snippet above demonstrates how to turn off SSR and downgrade to CSR-only, assuming you have a `pressureHandler` configured in [`underpressure`](https://github.com/fastify/under-pressure) to set a `underPressure` flag on your Fastify server instance.
